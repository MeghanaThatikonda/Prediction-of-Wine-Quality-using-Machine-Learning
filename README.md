# Predicting Wine Quality with Machine Learning in Python
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. 
The dataset for this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). 
A linear regression model is used to predict the wine quality score, allowing for insights into how specific features influence the quality.
